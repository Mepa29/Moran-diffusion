# Moran-diffusion:
Moran diffusion dynamics and fixation time on tree graphs.
This project exhibits a system containing two species the mutant and the host. There is a certain probability a mutant can affect adjacent hosts in a network. A mutant with some probabilities may take over the entire network or die out. 
A low-size simulation is brought for clearance of the concept as a gif file. 
(Not all the results are brought here: This is a contribution and after the main author submits the paper, I may include all)
## Project objectives:
*Investigation of Moran diffusion dynamics on tree and star graphs with variations in fitness and other parameters like network size.
*Exploring the influence of adding edges to tree graphs so they approach a complete graph.
*To analyze the behavior, searching for fixation time in various networks averaged over a hundred initial conditions to achieve a smoother plot without randomness effect.
